Homework for the sixth lesson

1. **task1** we created a class <code>"CreditCard"</code> with the fields <code>"Account number"</code> and <code>"Current amount on account"</code>.  
We have created a class <code>"Card Transaction"</code>.
In the class we created methods for increasing and decreasing the amount and   
output information to the console.


2. **task2** we created a class to describe the students of our group <code>(Student)</code>.  
Class fields: <code>first name</code>, <code>last name</code>, <code>passport number</code>, <code>group name</code>.  
We created objects of this class in the new Program class for each of the students in our group.  
We placed all these objects in an array.  
We went through the array with a <code>for-each</code> loop and output the information to the console.
